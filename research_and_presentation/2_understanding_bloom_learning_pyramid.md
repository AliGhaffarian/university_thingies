# Understanding Bloom Learning Pyramid  
  
## The problem  
Learning more about the Bloom learning pyramid.  
  
## Assumptions  
1.	Bloom's learning pyramid has something to do with learning.  
  
## Expected Solution  
1. Search the web for the initial keywords.  
2. Read and check the returned websites for context and determine if the provided article is reliable if not search for more websites using other search engines.  
3. Read the filtered articles for more context and keywords.  
4. Repeat the 1-4 process until the bloom learning is clear, that is we can determine the definition of bloom learning, its purpose, and applications.  
5. Provide a structured summary of the knowledge learned from the research.  
(The “Expected solution” pretty much sums up in the “Related Work Study” part, since the purpose of the research is not solving an actual problem, but rather understanding a well established concept.)

### Study Previous Works  
Benjamin Bloom and his collaborators published a framework in 1956 for categorizing subjective goals. This framework is regarded as the “Taxonomy of Educational Objectives.”  
David Krathwohl published a revised version of the Taxonomy of Educational Objectives in 2001.  
Both versions are hierarchal and each category/level depends on the one before it.  
The Bloom learning pyramid, while not an official term related to Bloom’s work, is a common representation of Bloom’s revised taxonomy, using a pyramid shaped diagram.  
  
### The Original Taxonomy  
The original taxonomy consists of 6 categories.  
  
#### Knowledge:  
Recalling facts, structures, processes, …  
#### Comprehension:  
Understanding what is the material that is being communicated.  
Making use of the material while not necessarily understanding or relating to the material deeply.  
#### Application:  
Using the comprehended abstract method or process to solve a particular and concrete scenario or problem.  
#### Analysis:  
Breaking down the process into smaller elements and understanding how they relate to each other and contribute to the main process.  
#### Synthesis:  
Putting back together the analyzed elements and knowing the process as a whole.  
#### Evaluation:  
Coming up with a conclusion, judging the value of the material or process.  
  
  
### The Revised Taxonomy  
The revised taxonomy is very similar to the original one with some key differences:  
1.	All the categories are changed to use verbs instead of nouns, to convey the message that thinking is an active process.  
2.	Create and evaluate levels are swapped places, making the creation the highest level of thinking skills.   
  
### Conclusion  
Bloom’s taxonomy is adopted by the academic world to ease the process of learning.  
Changes made to the original taxonomy made the create level the highest level of thinking skills.  
Bloom’s learning pyramid is a common but unofficial representation of Bloom’s revised taxonomy, using a pyramid shaped diagram to convey the hierarchal mindset behind it.
